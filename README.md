A couple of functions that process photos for a family project.

## Color_Equalize
An implementation of [GIMP's Color Auto Equalize](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-layer-equalize.html) 
The only original part of this project. :)

## Auto_Equalize
Stolen from [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31998428/opencv-python-equalizehist-colored-image).

### TODO
See if its possible to implement [CLAHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization#Contrast_Limited_AHE) in color domains to reduce noise in the clouds or something.
